# Smallbrain

## History

During the pandemic I rediscovered chess and played a lot of games with my friends.<br>
Then I started to program my first engine [python-smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/python-smallbrain) in python, with the help of python-chess.<br>

I quickly realized how slow python is for chess engine programming, so I started to learn C++.<br>
My first try was [cppsmallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/cppsmallbrain), though after some time I found the code very buggy and ugly.<br>
So I started [Smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain) from scratch, during that time, I also joined Stockfish development. <br>

After some time I began implementing a NNUE into Smallbrain, with the help of Luecx from [Koivisto](https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto).<br>
As of now Smallbrain has a NNUE trained on 1 billion depth 9 + depth 7 + 150 million depth 9 DFRC fens generated with the built in data generator and using [CudAD trainer](https://github.com/Luecx/CudAD) to ultimately train the network.

## News

The latest development versions support FRC/DFRC.

## Compile

Compile it using the Makefile

```
make -j
.\smallbrain.exe bench
```

compare the Bench with the Bench in the commit messages,
they should be the same.

or download the latest the latest executable directly over Github. <br>
At the bottom you should be able to find multiple different compiles, choose one that doesnt crash.

Ordered by performance you should try x86-64-avx2 first then x86-64-modern and at last x86-64.
If you want maximum performance you should compile Smallbrain yourself.

## UCI settings

- Hash
  The size of the hash table in MB.
- Threads
  The number of threads used for search.
- EvalFile
  The neural net used for the evaluation,
  currently only default.nnue exist.
- SyzygyPath
  Path to the syzygy files.
- UCI_ShowWDL
  Shows the WDL score in the UCI info.
- UCI_Chess960

## Engine specific uci commands

- go perft \<depth>
  calculates perft from a set position up to _depth_.
- print
  prints the current board
- eval
  prints the evaluation of the board.

## CLI commands

- bench
  Starts the bench.
- perft fen=\<fen> depth=\<depth>
  fen and depth are optional.
- -eval fen=\<fen>
- -version/--version/--v/-v
  Prints the version.
- -see
  Calculates the static exchange evaluation of the current position.
- -generate
  Starts the data generation.
- -tests

## Features

- Evaluation
  - As of v6.0 the NNUE training dataset was regenerated using depth 9 selfplay games + random 8 piece combinations.

## Datageneration

- Starts the data generation.

  ```
  -generate
  ```

- Specify the number of threads to use.
  default: 1

  ```
  threads=<int>
  ```

- If you want to start from a book instead of using random playout.
  default: ""

  ```
  book=<path/to/book>
  ```

- Path to TB, only used for adjudication.
  default: ""

  ```
  tb=<path/to/tb>
  ```

- Analysis depth, values between 7-9 are good.
  default: 7

  ```
  depth=<int>
  ```

- Analysis nodes, values between 2500-10000 are good.
  default: 0

  ```
  nodes=<int>
  ```

- The amount of hash in MB. This gets multiplied by the number of threads.
  default: 16

  ```
  hash=<int>
  ```

- Example:

```
.\smallbrain.exe -generate threads=30 book=E:\Github\Smallbrain\src\data\DFRC_openings.epd tb=E:/Chess/345
```

```
.\smallbrain.exe -generate threads=30 depth=7 hash=256 tb=F:\syzygy_5\3-4-5
.\smallbrain.exe -generate threads=30 depth=9 tb=H:/Chess/345
.\smallbrain.exe -generate threads=30 nodes=5000 tb=H:/Chess/345
```
